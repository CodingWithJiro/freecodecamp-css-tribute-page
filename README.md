A tribute page dedicated to one of the most iconic superheroes in comic book history — Batman. This page highlights his achievements, story, and the enduring legacy he holds in the DC Universe.

It was built entirely with HTML and CSS as part of the [**freeCodeCamp.org**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/) CSS course.
