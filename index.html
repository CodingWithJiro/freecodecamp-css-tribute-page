                Batman is one of the greatest heroes in the DC Multiverse. On a terrible night, Bruce Wayne watched his
                parents die, closed his eyes, and Batman opened them. While it would be years before he put on the cowl,
                he built himself into something that could take on any threat, a cunning detective and skilled fighter
                ready for the worst that Gotham could throw at him.

                Over the years, Batman has done some pretty amazing things as a hero. While he doesn't have powers, he's
                managed to do things that other heroes have only dreamed of, creating something special as Batman.

                    He's Foiled The Joker Again & Again
                </h2>

                <p>
                    The Joker and Batman are locked in an eternal battle; Batman is inextricably linked to the Joker's
                    creation so he's partly responsible for the terrors the Joker's caused. The Joker's been trying to
                    destroy Gotham for years, injecting his unique blend of chaos into things whenever he has a chance.
                    The Joker isn't just a mad dog; his plans are just as cunning as Batman's.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Batman has worked hard to keep the Joker's attacks to a minimum amount of damage and has stopped him
                    from even worse acts many times over the years. The Joker is no slouch and the fact that Batman has
                    stayed ahead of him at all is an accomplishment.

                    He's Stopped Ra's al Ghul
                </h2>

                <img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/batman-232-1st-ras-al-ghul.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=1.5"
                    alt="Ra's al Ghul talking with Batman." width="825" height="413">

                <p>
                    Ra's al Ghul has been a constant thorn in Batman's side. In a lot of ways, the two men represent two
                    sides of the same coin; they are both intelligent, skilled, and wealthy men who are trying to change
                    the world in their own ways. Luckily for the world, Batman has stood between the world and Ra's,
                    stopping his schemes on more than one occasion.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ra's al Ghul has often proved to be Batman's superior in ways that few other foes are, yet Batman
                    has always won every fight, no matter how close things have gotten. This speaks to just how good
                    Batman is when the chips are down.

                    He Took Back Gotham From Bane

                <p>
                    Bane is one of Batman's greatest foes and he was able to outsmart Batman, taking over Gotham City.
                    Bane did something few have ever done to Batman before, taking his city away from him and
                    outthinking him at every turn. The fact that Batman was ever able to come back from what Bane did to
                    him and beat him is amazing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While it wasn't exactly a flawless victory, as Alfred was killed before Batman could take back the
                    city, he came back from a massive defeat and overcame the odds Bane stacked against him, showing
                    just why he's such a great hero.

                <p>
                    Batman and Superman have long been the best of friends but with superheroes, that means they've also
                    fought a lot of times. One of the most impressive things about Batman is that he's been able to beat
                    Superman, which isn't something a lot of people can say. Sure, he uses his tricks against Superman
                    but the fact that they work says something about Batman.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Superman is one of the most dangerous beings in the DC Universe and just having a Kryptonite ring or
                    a plan doesn't mean he's suddenly easy to beat. Batman has been able to make it happen against
                    Superman, which is no easy task.

                    He's Beaten Darkseid
                </h2>

                <img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Batman-vs-Darkseid-DC.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=1.5"
                    alt="Batman punching Darkseid." width="825" height="413">

                <p>
                    Darkseid is one of the greatest forces of evil in the DC Multiverse. Few beings out there can match
                    his power or his depravity; whenever he attacks, it's an all-hands-on-deck moment. Batman and
                    Darkseid have tangled several times and somehow, Batman has always beaten the God of Evil.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Batman is smart enough to know he can't beat Darkseid in a straight-up fight, even with the powerful
                    Hellbat armor. Instead, he uses what he knows to beat Darkseid, using his brains and all of his
                    resources to win. He's even walked into Apokolips and walked out alive again, which isn't exactly
                    something that happens a lot.
